This is the documentation for the **MDI manager** utility,
delivered in the form of an **R package**.
It will help you install and run the MDI on your server,
desktop or laptop computer. Functions initialize Stage 1 pipeline
execution and help launch the Stage 2 web apps.

### Other ways to call the MDI R functions

While the MDI R package is at the heart of most installations
and is required to run Stage 2 Apps, many users will never
use its R functions directly as they are called for
you by other scripts and utilities, including:

- MDI command line utility: <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi.git>
- MDI batch scripts: <https://wilsonte-umich.shinyapps.io/mdi-script-generator/>

However, if you prefer, you can <code>install()</code> and 
<code>run()</code> from within R.
