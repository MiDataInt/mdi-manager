# `run`

Run the Michigan Data Interface (MDI) in a web server


## Description

`run()` launches the suites of data analysis applications that comprise
 the Michigan Data Interface (MDI) in a web server, either on a web host
 that is publicly addressable, on your local computer, or on on a cluster
 compute node or other ssh accessible server. `develop()` is a shortcut
 to `run()` with settings appropriate for developers (mode='local',
 browser=FALSE, debug=TRUE, developer=TRUE).


## Usage

```r
run(
  mdiDir = "~",
  dataDir = NULL,
  hostDir = NULL,
  mode = "local",
  install = TRUE,
  url = "http://localhost",
  port = NULL,
  browser = mode %in% c("local"),
  debug = FALSE,
  developer = FALSE,
  checkout = NULL
)
develop(
  mdiDir = "~",
  dataDir = NULL,
  url = "http://localhost",
  port = NULL,
  ...
)
remote(mdiDir = "~", dataDir = NULL, hostDir = NULL, port = NULL, ...)
node(mdiDir = "~", dataDir = NULL, hostDir = NULL, port = NULL, ...)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`mdiDir`     |     character. Path to the directory where the MDI has previously been installed. Defaults to your home directory, such that the MDI will run from '~/mdi' by default.
`dataDir`     |     character. Path to the directory where your MDI apps data can be found. Defaults to ' `mdiDir` /data'. You might wish to change this to a directory that holds shared data, e.g., for your laboratory.
`hostDir`     |     character. Path to the directory where a hosted, i.e., a shared public, installation of the MDI can be found. The following folders from that installation will be used instead of from the user installation executing the `mdi::run()` command: config, containers, environments, library, and resources. Option `hostDir` must be set if you ran `mdi::install()` with option `installPackages` set to FALSE.
`mode`     |     character. Controls aspects of server behavior. The following valid values will help you properly run the MDI web server on/in: local = your desktop or laptop; remote = a server you have direct access to via SSH; node = a worker node in a Slurm cluster, accessed via SSH to a login node; server = a server container on a publicly addressable cloud instance. Most users manually calling `mdi::run()` want 'local' (the default).
`install`     |     logical. When TRUE (the default), `mdi::run()` will clone or pull all repositories and install any missing R packages. Setting `install` to FALSE will allow the server to start a bit more quickly. Ignored when `mode` is 'node', since cluster nodes are not expected to have internet access to download software.
`url`     |     character. The complete browser URL to load the web page. Examples: 'http://localhost' (the default) or 'https://mymdi.org'.
`port`     |     integer. The port to use on the host specified in `url` . Defaults to letting R Shiny select a random port. Example: setting `url`  to 'https://mymdi.org' and `port` to 5000 will yield a final access url of 'https://mymdi.org:5000/'.
`browser`     |     logical. Whether or not to attempt to launch a web browser after starting the MDI server. Defaults to FALSE unless `mode` is 'local'.
`debug`     |     logical. When `debug` is TRUE, verbose activity logs will be printed to the R console where `mdi::run()` was called. Defaults to FALSE.
`developer`     |     logical. When `developer` is TRUE, additional development utilities are added to the web page and forked repositories will be used if they exist. Ignored if `mode` is set to 'server'.
`checkout`     |     list.  When not NULL (the default), a list of version tags, branch names, or git commit identifiers to check out prior to installing Stage 2 R packages and launching the apps server, of form `list(framework = "v0.0.0", suites = list(<suiteName> = "v0.0.0", ...))`  where framework refers to the mdi-apps-framework. If `checkout` or the list entry for a git repository is NULL or NA, the latest release tag will be checked out prior to installation (ignored for developer-forks of git repos). Finally, if `checkout` is FALSE, no git checkout actions will be taken.


## Details

All default settings are consistent with an end user running the MDI in
 local mode on their desktop or laptop computer.
 
 `mdiDir` must be the same directory as used in a prior call to
 `mdi::install()` .
 
 When `developer` is FALSE, `run()` will use the definitive
 version of all repositories checked out to the latest version tag on
 the 'main' branch (or the tip of main if no version tags are set),
 unless version overrides are provided via the `checkout` option.
 
 When `developer` is TRUE, `run()` will use a developer-forks
 repository for each framework or suite when it exists, otherwise, it
 will fall back to the definitive repository. Forked repos will be left
 on whatever branch they were already on, whereas definitive repos
 will be checked out to the tip of the 'main' branch.
 
 If access to private repositories or developer forks is needed, you must
 create script 'gitCredentials.R' in `mdiDir` or your home directory,
 to be sourced by `mdi::run()` , with the following contents:
 gitCredentials <- list(
 USER_NAME  = "First Last",
 USER_EMAIL = "lastf@example.com",
 GIT_USER   = "xxx",
 GITHUB_PAT = "xxx"
 )
 where GIT_USER and GITHUB_PAT are the username and Personal Access
 Token of a GitHub account that holds any developer forks and/or grants
 permissions for accessing any tool suites that have restricted access.
 You should protect gitCredentials.R by removing read permissions for
 anyone except yourself. If you are uncomfortable storing sensitive
 information on disk, you may alternatively set gitCredentials values
 in the environment using Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "xxx"), etc., prior to
 calling `mdi::run()` .


## Value

These functions never return. They launch a blocking web server
 that runs perpeptually in the parent R process in the global environment.
