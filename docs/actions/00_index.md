The MDI manager functions are called from within an R console 
or script using commands similar to:

```r
# R console
mdi::install()
```

```sh
# bash prompt or script
Rscript -e "mdi::run()"
```

Click on each command to view a complete description 
of its actions and options. There are
more options than will typically needed by most users - 
they are used by the utilities that wrap these functions.
