The MDI job manager actions are called from within an R console 
or script using commands similar to:

```
mdi::install()
Rscript -e "mdi::run()"
```

Click on each command to view a complete description 
of its actions and options. Please note that there are
many more options than will typically needed by most end users - 
they are used by utilities that wrap these functions.
